/**
 * Returns a `Managed` value that represents a managed resource that can
 * be safely swapped within the scope of the `Managed`. The function provided
 * inside the `Managed` can be used to switch the resource currently in use.
 *
 * When the resource is switched, the finalizer for the previous finalizer will
 * be executed uninterruptibly. If the effect executing inside the `use`
 * is interrupted, the finalizer for the resource currently in use is guaranteed
 * to execute.
 *
 * This constructor can be used to create an expressive control flow that uses
 * several instances of a managed resource.
